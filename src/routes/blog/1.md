It was Joshua Tree National Park that had drawn me to this part of southern California but, with time on my hands, there were plentiful opportunities to explore outside the park as well. 

29 Palms, where I was holed up in an RV park full of Trumpers, backs on to the Mojave Desert. An empty desert, seemingly home to too many broken dreams to count. And the final resting place for trailers and homes, abandoned when the dream became too difficult to sustain. Well-preserved in the dry hot climate.

Numbers of people came here, it seems, full of optimism. The California Dream? And like previous rushes, this one didn't pan out. Was it the sub-prime mortgage crisis of 2008? The dot-com crash of 2001? Cheap, available land in the desert?

Like old abandoned farmhouses of my home province of Alberta, they intrigue me: what stories could they tell? Life happened within these now empty shells. And death, too, most likely. Heartbreak, certainly, as dreams faded into ruin.
